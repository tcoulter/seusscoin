# SEUSSCOIN

A basic coin wallet application based on Ethereum (in other words, a distributed application, or dApp), which includes scripts for deploying contracts, as well as docker files for development and deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

This is a good example of a dApp, but the opportunities are far rich and complex. Use this as a starting point to build your own.

PS: Don't use the frontend Javascript (index.coffee). That's bad code. :)

Cheers!
Tim
